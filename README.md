# 2DLaserScanner
MATLAB data acquisition interface based 2D Laser Scanning and Imager

This is MATLAB 2020a + data acquisition toobox based simple laser scanning microscope software
you need National instruments' DAQ with two AO channels and at least One AI channel
I tested with PCIe-6321
Sawtooth shaped scanning with trim out lag parts are possible

This script is highly inspired from the tenss/SimpleMScanner and MATLAB help files
